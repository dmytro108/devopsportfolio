I recently earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, a big step in my career. I learned about AWS services, cloud basics, security, and cost management. To prepare, I used online courses, hands-on practice, and took practice exams. This certification boosted my confidence and now I'm ready to pursue more advanced AWS certifications. I'm excited to keep learning and use my new skills in future projects.

## Project description
The project addresses key challenges in DevOps workflows, such as inconsistent project setups, inefficient handling of large files, and the need for streamlined collaboration and code quality management. The goal was to establish a scalable, flexible, and efficient DevOps environment. The solution comprised configuring a suite of tools including Docker, GitLab, Minio, SonarQube, Terraform, and Terragrunt. These were orchestrated to work seamlessly, ensuring an optimized workflow for continuous development, integration, and deployment. The outcome is a standardized, automated, and secure project environment on the GitLab server, enhancing overall productivity and code quality.

Tools and technologies used encompass Docker for containerization, GitLab CE server and CI/CD runner for version control and automation, Minio S3 storage for handling large files, SonarQube for code quality checks, and Terraform along with Terragrunt for infrastructure provisioning. This project covers a broad range of DevOps tasks, including setup and configuration, integration of storage and CI/CD solutions, static code analysis, IaC implementation, and code validation.

## Project highlights
1. **Docker Containers Setup**: Skills in Docker containerization were essential to configure the GitLab CE server, CI/CD runner, Minio S3 storage server, and SonarQube. This task required a deep understanding of Docker and its ecosystem.  
2. **GitLab and Minio Integration**: The integration of GitLab with Minio as a GitLab LFS backend needed expertise in both GitLab and Minio configurations, focusing on efficient large file management.
3. **Terraform Module Writing**: This involved IaC skills for creating resources on GitLab using Terraform. The use of Minio S3 as a backend and Terragrunt indicated advanced knowledge in Terraform and infrastructure management.
4. **Code Verification with External Tools**: Using tfsec, tflint, and checkov for code verification highlighted competencies in code security, linting, and compliance, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the infrastructure code.
